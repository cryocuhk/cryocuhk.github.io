I currently work on the timeseries of surface kinematics of rock glaciers, mainly using InSAR but also field measurements. My PhD is supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme, for which I am deeply grateful. I studied Earth Sciences as an undergraduate at the University of Oxford, where I completed an integrated master's degree.
